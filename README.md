# Working-with-VPNs

## Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and securing communication.

## Tool Used
- ProtonVPN (Free tier)

## Steps Taken
1. Signed up for a ProtonVPN free account.
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client.
3. Connected to a free VPN server (Netherlands server).
4. Verified new IP address and location using [whatismyipaddress.com].
5. Browsed a website (https://openai.com) to test encrypted traffic.
6. Disconnected VPN and confirmed IP returned to original.
7. Compared browsing speed with and without VPN.

## Observations
- **Before VPN**:  
  - Real IP address starting with 156.x.x.x (real IP hidden for privacy).
  - Normal browsing speed.  
- **After VPN**:  
  - IP address changed to Netherlands 185.177.125.137  
  - Website loaded, but chat features on OpenAI didnâ€™t load (likely blocked by VPN IP).
  - Browsing speed noticeably slower (free server congestion).

## Benefits of VPN
- Hides real IP and masks location.
- Encrypts internet traffic between device and VPN server.
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi.
- Helps bypass certain geo-restrictions.

## Limitations of VPN
- Can reduce browsing speed, especially on free plans.
- Some websites/services may block VPN IPs.
- Requires trust in the VPN provider.
- Free plans have limited server choices.

## Summary
ProtonVPN successfully masked my IP and encrypted my traffic. However, I experienced slower browsing speeds and partial website functionality due to VPN IP blocking. VPNs are valuable for privacy, but choosing a reputable provider and understanding their limitations is important.
